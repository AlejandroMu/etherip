Version number is in EtherNetIP.version

* 1.4 - 2018/03/19
Replace the constant 'Funstuff' context marker with
a string that cycled from '00000001' to 'FFFFFFFF',
then starting over.

John Priller had found that this can be used to detect a request/response
mismatch that he observed when other, non-PLC devices like cameras flooded the network.
In most cases, the driver would report timeouts or read errors, but in rare cases
the reply seemed to contain the wrong values.
By sending each request with a unique context marker, then comparing the context marker
in the response, he was able to detect and then ignore some mismatched replies.
